Go Video
========

I find generation of video generally pretty slow. We rely on opencv to help write frames out to disk. I can get up to 1000 fps so that is alright. I wanted to try Go out and I had a problem to be solved. It seemed to work ok, but the opencv module is a little broken and required me to manually modify it.

Requirements
============

* golang
* opencv
* go-opencv
* some images

Build
=====

go build

or 

go run govid.go *png
